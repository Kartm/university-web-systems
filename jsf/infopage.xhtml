        <h:outputFormat value='Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola in the Duchy of 
                        Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part 
                        of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his 
                        musical education and composed his earlier works in 
                        Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than
                        a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 
                        Uprising. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter – in 
                        the last 18 years of his life – he gave only 30 public 
                        performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of
                        the salon. He supported himself by selling his 
                        compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he 
                        was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with 
                        Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical
                        contemporaries, including Robert Schumann.' />
