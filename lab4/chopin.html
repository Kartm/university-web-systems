  >Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter – in the last 18 years of his life – he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand.
		Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann.

	<h2>Not that important</h2>
	<p>After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, George Sand). A brief and unhappy visit to Mallorca with Sand in 1838–39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. For most of his life,
		Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of pericarditis aggravated by tuberculosis.

	<details>
		<summary>What happened in Paris</summary>
		When he left Warsaw in late 1830, Chopin had intended to go to Italy, but violent unrest there made that a dangerous 
		destination. His next choice was Paris; difficulties obtaining a visa from Russian authorities resulted in his 
		obtaining transit permission from the French. In later years he would quote the passport's endorsement 
		"Passeport en passant par Paris à Londres" ("In transit to London via Paris"), joking that he was in the city 
		"only in passing." Chopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to Poland, 
		thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France, he used the French versions of 
		his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin 
		remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking 
		French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's 
		French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.
