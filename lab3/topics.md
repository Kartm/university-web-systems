1. How is the form validated? Is all data automatically validated? How do I force no validation?

- required attribute causes form to not submit if an input is empty. The missing field will get focused and there will be an error message.
- yes
- by adding novalidation attribute

2. Is the date input type displayed the same in every browser? If not, please state what the
   differences are.

- In Chrome there's a dropdown that opens the date picker.
- In Firefox the date picker opens immediately after clicking the input.
- The date picker UI differs between the browsers as well.

3. Can the placeholder attribute be applied to all types of input elements? If not, please list
   at least 3 types.

- submit
- color
- range
